## Verification Process

Community requests go through a verification process:

1. Request Submission: Requesters submit detailed information about their needs, including location, contact information, and specific requirements.

2. Initial Review: Platform administrators review requests to ensure they align with Hungry Saver's initiatives and meet basic criteria.

3. Volunteer Review: Approved requests become visible to volunteers who can review details and accept requests they can fulfill.

4. Volunteer Approval: Volunteers who accept requests may need to verify certain details with the requester before proceeding.

5. Fulfillment: Once a volunteer accepts a request, they coordinate with the requester to deliver the needed support.

The verification process helps ensure that requests are legitimate and that resources reach those who need them most.

## How Support is Delivered

Support delivery follows these steps:

1. Request Visibility: Approved requests appear in the volunteer dashboard for the requester's city.

2. Volunteer Acceptance: Volunteers review request details and accept requests they can fulfill.

3. Coordination: Volunteers contact requesters to confirm details, verify addresses, and arrange delivery.

4. Donor Connection: In some cases, volunteers may connect requests with available donations, or requesters may receive direct donations from donors.

5. Delivery: Volunteers deliver the requested support to the specified location.

6. Confirmation: Once delivery is complete, volunteers confirm the delivery, and requesters can provide feedback.

The delivery process ensures that support reaches beneficiaries in a timely and organized manner while maintaining dignity and respect for all parties involved.
